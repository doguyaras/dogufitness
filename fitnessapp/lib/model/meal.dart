      timeTaken: "16",
      imagePath: "assets/keto_snack.jpg",
      ingredients: [
        "4 slices bacon",

      preparation:
      '''STEP 1
Prepare the bacon by placing the bacon in a cold pan or skillet, then heating up on low heat. Once the bacon starts to curl, flip over and keep on low heat, flipping constantly.

STEP 2
Prepare the eggs while the bacon is cooking by boiling enough water in a pot to cover the eggs. Once the water is boiling, carefully place the eggs in the water with a slotted spoon. Boil for 6 minutes, then carefully remove the peel under cold running water.

STEP 3
After the bacon is cooked, remove from heat, pat dry with paper towel, and crumble. Drain out any bacon fat but donâ€™t clean the pan. Add the spinach and saute until wilted.

STEP 4
To build your bowls, add sauteed spinach, crumbled bacon, sliced cherry tomatoes, and avocado. Cut the egg in half and sprinkle on Everything Seasoning or a dash of pepper.'''),
